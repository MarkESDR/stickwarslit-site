title: Improving Efficiently
---

At one point or another, you wanted to become a better programmer. Your reasons for doing so may very. Developers make a lot of money. Software can improve the lives of its users. Whatever the reason, increasing the quality of code would get you there. Realizing this now, what do you do?

First, you might focus on the code you're writing. You run your code through linters. You write more documentation. You remove duplicate code. You make your function names more descriptive. You apply every good idea and best practice you've stumbled across.

But, you reach a certain point in the day.  You feel groggy after a heavy restaurant lunch. Or the effects of two hours of sleep are finally catching up to you. Whatever the reason, your attentiveness begins to wane. 

Despite the weariness, you push on anyway. After all, you're a coder (or trying to become one). What else does a coder do but a code? Onward you march.

Without realizing it, your output quality dips. You copy snippets from stack overflow without knowing how it works. You skip over failing tests so your updates pass. You set random booleans to true and hope the code works. Whatever it takes to get that feature or ticket or whatsoever completed. Just code and code and code.

What was your goal again? Become a better programmer? You look at your code, a spaghetti mess that will be a nightmare for future maintainers. Have you  become a better developer compared to before you set out to work? In the beginning you were implementing good ideas. Yet those improvements are not reflected in the final product. 

At first, the idea of coding more can make you worse seems counterintuitive. Coding is a skill, and skills need practice to hone. After all, it requires 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill. We worship hustlers working 10 hour days to get the job done. You are walking the same time-honored path.

In practice, there is a limit to how much you can work. Human beings are only capable of a few hours of active concentration every day. These peak hours are when you will produce your best work and sharpen your skills. The question is, what to do with the rest of the hours in the day?

There are many lower strain activities that can increase your coding abilities. You can read articles about relevant technologies. If you like socializing, you can talk on discussion boards or attend IRL meetups. If you have ideas, you could even start writing a blog. Doing this actions will not create a tangible improvement in your skills or products. But, they will influence you into better decision making while you work.

I am not advocating doing something programming or tech-related all the time. You need to take time off. Go for walks. Exercise. Spend time with loved ones. Sleep (please). I also don't advocate spending all your working hours skimming through articles. As long as you balance passive learning and active application, you will see results. Remember that coding doesn't have to end when you stop typing in your text editor.
